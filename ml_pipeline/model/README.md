# Crypto prediction
In this first iteration of the project I'll crate a notebook as an exploratory way to understand the data, get some insights and crate a first model or proof of concept to predict the prices.
After theses steps we can move the explorations results from a notebook to a python file and integrate into a pipeline. But we will keep the notebook as a history of the first model steps.
